I'm Aarush, a student at MIT studying computer science and engineering along with physics. 

My current interests span software + systems engineering, ML/AI, and digital HW design â€” I also love working on problems at the intersections of these fields. Check out my pinned repositories to see some of the projects I've been working on!
